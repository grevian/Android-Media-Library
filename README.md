# Android Media Library

This project is an android application to keep track of movie, book, and game
collections. It works by scanning the barcode of just about anything and
looking it up on upcdatabase.com, then storing its name and description. Users
can then search for media, or scan something to see if they own it or not.
(This was a problem for myself and a friend of mine, I own more than a hundred
DVDs, and he owns several hundred.)

# TODO

I'd love to have social integration with this application, to track media when
it is lent out, or to compare to friends collections. I also would like to move
over from upcdatabase.com to Amazon for media lookups, since the administrator
of upcdatabase.com is pretty unresponsive. 

# Warning

This application is almost certainly obsolete, It was programmed targetting
android 1.5 when 1.6 was the hot new thing. It was a beginner application for
me to learn a bit about android programming, and upcdatabase.com may have
changed their usage policies or API.
